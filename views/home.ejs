   <h3>LACK OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION🥺</h3>
   <p>Lately I had a misunderstanding with my friend because I didn’t get the tone of his voice distinctly through text messages this made us feel bad about each other. The quality of conversation is awful because we cannot sense the emotion or enthusiasm from the other person. It makes you wonder what they actually meant.</p>
   <h3>LAZINESS😪</h3>
   <p>This new aeon is in its progress of making super lazy society. People inside their own house used to notify through smart phones instead conveying the message in person. By choice we prefer calling a friend through network rather than running to them.</p>
<h3>SHORTFALL OF FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION👥</h3>
<p>It led us to a society where a person shares his/her entire life journey to an unknown person met online. As more people have access to social media via their  mobile phones whenever they please, this worsens people to acquire smartphone. It has the tendency to make people communicate online rather in person because it  made the process simpler. A simple process may cover people to give that a go. So this had become habitual to many of us. Sometimes people can get over connected with blog or gaming console so that they lose connection with friends and family.</p>
<h3>CYBERBULLYING🧐</h3>
<p>People got harassed by means of digital platform especially social media. Harassing an individual by posting some toxic rumors about them, sexual remarks, pejorative labels, spreading once personal life without their knowledge and threats these are considered as harmful bullying behavior. Social media has spread this comfort sphere wider so that anyone can spread any kind of rumor about anything and anyone. This drives those affected individuals to emotional instability, mental illness, suicide and depression. Not all negative interchange shared online or on social media meant as cyberbullying, one which affects a person’s stable nature is considered as cyberbullying.</p><br>
