<h1>Self-Publishing</h1>
<p>Self-publishing is not a new phenomenon. While most novels were distributed by established publishers, there have been authors who chose to self-publish, or even start their own presses, such as John Locke</p>
<p>Jane Austen, Emily Dickinson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Martin Luther, Marcel Proust, Derek Walcott, and Walt Whitman.[6] In 1759, British satirist Laurence Sterne's self-published the first two volumes of Tristram Shandy.[6] In 1908, Ezra Pound sold A Lume Spento for six pence each.[6] Franklin Hiram King's book Farmers of Forty Centuries was self-published in 1911, and was subsequently published commercially. In 1931 the author of The Joy of Cooking paid a local printing company to print 3000 copies; the Bobbs-Merrill Company acquired the rights, and since then the book has sold over 18 million copies.[7] In 1941, writer Virginia Woolf chose to self-publish her final novel Between the Acts on her Hogarth Press, in effect starting her own press.</p>

<h3>Stigma</h3>
<p>Until the advent of ebooks and POD technology, most self-published books were published through a vanity press,[9] so called because such authors were assumed to be egotistical writers, unable to accept their work was not good enough to be accepted by traditional publishers.[9] James D. Macdonald claimed that vanity publishing violated Yog's Law which states that "Money should flow toward the author."[10] Vanity publishing usually required a one-time payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to do a print run of 1000 books; these books usually ended up in boxes in a garage.</p>
<h3>Technology Changes</h3>
<p>A huge impetus to self-publishing has been rapid advances in technology, particularly the exponential growth of the Internet and a general shift from analog to digital technology.[4] The Internet has been described as a "great equalizer" in the publishing world, since it enables an author to put their books out there and "stand naked before the world."[14] Costs for printing and distributing a book have fallen dramatically.[4][18] Advances in e-book readers and tablet computers have improved readability; such devices allow readers to "carry" numerous books in a small portable device.[4] These technologies make it possible to have a book printed or digitally delivered after an order has been placed, so there are no costs for storing inventory. Print-On-Demand (or POD) technology, which became available in the mid-1990s,[18] can produce a high quality product equal to those produced by traditional publishers; in the past, one could easily identify a self-published title by its lack of quality.[18] Print-on-demand was easy, since an author could simply upload a manuscript, choose an interior file format and a cover, and the book could be printed as needed, avoiding warehousing costs, and reducing the risk of being stuck with a huge unsold inventory.[18] Further, the Internet provides access to global distribution channels via online retailers, so a self-published book can be instantly available to book buyers worldwide. A Canada-based firm named Wattpad offers streaming video productions based on the stories of self-published authors as of 2017</p>
<h3>Self-publishing-today</h3>
<p>In recent times the publishing industry as a whole is in a great deal of flux, in a sort of "Wild Wild West" state.[4] The online retailing giant, Amazon, has had a huge impact on the book-selling industry, driving many brick-and-mortar bookstores out of business and making inroads into publishing as well. Amazon has enticed readers away from bookstores and into an online environment, and its KDP and CreateSpace distribution channels have spawned a huge growth in self-publishing. As a result, the numbers of self-published authors are ever-increasing.[21]

    There is an anti-establishment aspect to self-publishing, in that it has been seen historically as a way to defy authority or resist oppression.[22] The self-publishing movement can also be viewed as a part of the Do-it-yourself culture which "flourishes in environments of communitarian support."[22] A writer who is rejected by the usual system can find solace in self-publishing.[4] Some struggling authors complained that the traditional publishing model was too "insular", keeping out different ideas about stories as well as ones with unusual characters or plotlines, or which dealt with minorities, and self-publishing was a way for these formerly outcast writers to connect with readers.[23] Libraries have also become involved with self-publishing; the Library Journal and Biblioboard worked together to create a self-publishing platform called Self-e in which authors submit books online which are made available to readers. These books are reviewed by Library Journal, and the best ones are published nationwide; authors do not make money this way but it serves as a marketing too</p>
